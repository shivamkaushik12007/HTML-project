<h1>Can Bone Cancer Be Found Early?</h1>

<p> </p>

<p>There are tests that can be used to find some cancers early (such as breast, cervical, colorectal, and skin), before they cause symptoms. At this time, no special tests are available to find bone cancers early. The best way to find these cancers early is to see a health care provider right away if you have signs and symptoms of this disease.</p>


<h1>Signs and Symptoms of Bone Cancer</h1>

<p> </p>

<h2>Pain</h2>
<p>Pain in the affected bone is the most common sign of bone cancer. At first, the pain is not constant. It may be worse at night or when the bone is used, for instance, leg pain when walking. As the cancer grows, the pain will be there all the time, and get worse with activity.</p>
<h2>Swelling</h2>
<p>Swelling in the area of the pain may not occur until weeks later. It might be possible to feel a lump or mass depending on where the tumor is.</p>
<p>Cancers in the bones of the neck can cause a lump in the back of the throat that can lead to trouble swallowing or make it hard to breathe.</p>
<h2>Fractures</h2>
<p>Bone cancer can weaken the bone it's in, but most of the time the bones do not fracture (break). People with a fracture next to or through a bone tumor usually describe sudden severe pain in a bone that had been sore for a few months.</p>
<h2>Other symptoms</h2>
<p>Cancer in the bones of the spine can press on nerves, causing numbness and tingling or even weakness.</p>
<p>Cancer can cause weight loss and fatigue. If the cancer spreads to internal organs it may cause other symptoms, too. For instance, if the cancer spreads to the lungs, it can cause trouble breathing.</p>
<p><strong>These symptoms are more often due to conditions other than cancer, such as injuries or arthritis. Still, if these problems go on for a long time without a known reason, you should see your doctor.</strong></p>



<h1>Tests for Bone Cancer</h1>

<p> </p>
<p>Symptoms, a physical exam, and the results of imaging tests, and blood tests might suggest that a person has bone cancer. But in most cases, doctors must confirm this by testing a tissue or cell sample and checking it with a microscope (a procedure known as a biopsy).</p>
<p><strong>Accurate diagnosis of a bone tumor often depends on combining information about what bone is affected and which part of the bone is involved, how it looks on x-rays, and what the cells look like under a microscope.</strong></p>
<p>Other diseases, like bone infections, can cause symptoms and imaging results that might be confused with bone cancer.</p>
<p>Bone metastasis can also look like primary bone cancer. Bone tumors are more often caused by cancer that has spread to the bone from some other part of the body. This is a bone metastasis. A single bone metastasis can have the same signs and symptoms as a primary bone tumor, so many doctors require a biopsy to diagnose a patient's first bone metastasis. After that, new bone metastases can usually be diagnosed based on x-rays and other imaging tests.</p>
<h2>Imaging tests</h2>
<h3>X-rays</h3>
<p>Most bone cancers show up on x-rays of the bone. The bone at the site of the cancer may look ragged instead of solid. The cancer can also appear as a hole in the bone. Sometimes doctors can see a tumor around the defect in the bone that might extend into nearby tissues (such as muscle or fat). The radiologist (doctor who specializes in reading x-rays) can often tell if a tumor is malignant by the way it appears on the x-ray, but only a biopsy can tell for sure.</p>
<p>A chest x-ray is often done to see if bone cancer has spread to the lungs.</p>
<h3>Computed tomography (CT) scans</h3>
<p>CT scans are helpful in staging cancer. They help show if the bone cancer has spread to your lungs, liver, or other organs. The scans show the lymph nodes and distant organs where there might be cancer spread.</p>
<p>CT scans can also be used to guide a biopsy needle into a tumor. This is called a CT-guided needle biopsy. For this test, you stay on the CT scanning table while a radiologist moves a biopsy needle toward the tumor. CT scans are repeated until the tip of the needle is within the mass. (See Needle biopsy below.)</p>
<h3>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans</h3>
<p>MRI scans are often the best test for outlining a bone tumor. They are very helpful for looking at the brain and spinal cord.</p>
<h3>Radionuclide bone scans</h3>
<p>Bone scans can show if a cancer has spread to other bones. It can find smaller areas of metastasis than regular x-rays. Bone scans also can show how much damage the cancer has caused in the bone.</p>
<p>Areas of diseased bone will be seen on the bone scan as dense, gray to black areas, called hot spots. These areas suggest cancer is present, but arthritis, infection, or other bone diseases can also cause hot spots. Other imaging tests or a bone biopsy may be needed to know what's causing the change.</p>
<h3>Positron emission tomography (PET or PET) scans</h3>
<p>PET scans use glucose (a form of sugar) that's attached to a radioactive atom. A special camera can detect the radioactivity. Cancer cells absorb a lot of the radioactive sugar because of their high rate of metabolism. PET scans are useful in looking for cancer throughout your entire body. It can sometimes help tell if a tumor is cancer or not cancer (benign). It's often combined with CT scans to better pinpoint some kinds of cancer.</p>
<h2>Biopsy</h2>
<p>A biopsy takes a piece of tissue from a tumor so that it can be looked at with a microscope and tested in the lab. This is the only way to know that the tumor is cancer and not another bone disease.</p>
<p>If it is cancer, the biopsy can tell the doctor if it's a primary bone cancer or cancer that started somewhere else and spread to the bone (metastasis). Many<em> </em>types of tissue and cell samples are used to diagnose bone cancer. It's very important that your biopsy be done by a surgeon with experience in diagnosing and treating bone tumors.</p>
<p>The type of biopsy done is based on whether the tumor looks benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer) and exactly what type of tumor it most likely is (based on x-rays, the patient's age, and where the tumor is). Some kinds of bone tumors can be diagnosed from needle biopsy samples, but larger samples (from a surgical biopsy) are often needed to diagnose other types.</p>
<p>Whether the surgeon plans to remove the entire tumor during the biopsy will also impact the type of biopsy done. Sometimes the wrong kind of biopsy can make it hard for the surgeon to later remove all of the cancer without having to also remove all or part of the arm or leg containing the tumor. It also may cause the cancer to spread.</p>
<h3>Needle biopsy</h3>
<p>There are 2 types of needle biopsies:<strong> fine (aspiration) </strong>and <strong>core</strong><em>.</em> For both types, a drug is first used to numb the area for the biopsy.</p>
<p>For <strong>fine needle aspiration</strong> (FNA), the doctor uses a very thin needle and a syringe to take out a small amount of fluid and some cells from the tumor. Sometimes, the doctor can aim the needle by feeling the tumor if it's near the surface of the body. If the tumor is too deep to feel, the doctor can guide the needle while looking a CT scan. This is called a CT guided needle biopsy and it is often done by an x-ray specialist known as an interventional radiologist.</p>
<p>In a <strong>core needle biopsy</strong>, the doctor uses a larger needle to remove a small cylinder of tissue (about 1/16 inch in diameter and 1/2 inch long). Many experts feel that a core needle biopsy is better than FNA to diagnose a primary bone cancer.</p>
<h3>Surgical bone biopsy</h3>
<p>In this procedure, a surgeon needs to cut through the skin to reach the tumor to remove a small piece of tissue. This is also called an<strong> incisional biopsy</strong>. If the entire tumor is removed (not just a small piece), it's called an <strong>excisional biopsy</strong>.</p>
<p>These biopsies are often done with the patient under general anesthesia (drugs are used to put you into a deep asleep). They can also be done using a nerve block, which numbs a large area. If this type of biopsy is needed, it's important that the surgeon who will later remove the cancer also be the one to do the biopsy.</p>
