<h1>Surgery for Bone Cancer</h1>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Surgery is the primary (main) treatment for most kinds of bone cancer.</strong> Surgery may also be needed to do a biopsy of the cancer (take out some of the tumor so it can be tested in the lab). The biopsy and the surgical treatment are separate operations, but it's very important that the doctor plans both together. It's best if the same surgeon does both the biopsy and the main surgery. A biopsy taken from the wrong place can lead to problems when the surgeon does the operation to remove the cancer. Sometimes a poorly done biopsy can make it impossible to remove the cancer without cutting off the limb.</p>
<p><strong>The main goal of surgery is to remove all of the cancer. </strong>If even a few cancer cells are left behind, they can grow and make a new tumor. To try to be sure that this doesn't happen, surgeons remove the tumor plus some of the normal tissue around it. This is called <strong>wide-excision</strong>. Taking out some normal tissue helps ensure that all of the cancer is removed.</p>
<p>After surgery, a pathologist will look at the tissue that was removed to see if the margins (outer edges) have cancer cells. If cancer cells are seen at the edges of the tissue, the margins are called positive. Positive margins can mean that some cancer was left behind. When no cancer is seen at the edges of the tissue, the margins are said to be negative, clean, or clear. A wide-excision with clean margins minimizes the risk that the cancer will grow back where it started.</p>
<h2>Tumors in the arms or legs</h2>
<p>Sometimes the entire limb needs to be removed in order to do a good wide-excision and remove all of the cancer. This operation is called an <strong>amputation</strong>. But most of the time the surgeon can remove the cancer without amputation. This is called <strong>limb-salvage</strong> or <strong>limb-sparing surgery</strong>.</p>
<p>When taking about treatment options, it's important to discuss the advantages and disadvantages with either type of surgery. For example, most people prefer limb-salvage over amputation, but it's a more complex operation and can have more complications. Both operations have the same overall survival rates when done by expert surgeons. Studies looking at quality of life have shown little difference in how people react to the final result of the different procedures. Still, emotional issues can be very important and support and encouragement are needed for all patients.</p>
<p>No matter which type of surgery is done, rehabilitation will be needed afterward. This can be the hardest part of treatment. If possible, the patient should meet with a rehab specialist before surgery to understand what will be involved.</p>
<h3>Amputation</h3>
<p>Amputation is surgery to remove part or all of a limb (an arm or leg). When used to treat cancer, amputation removes the part of the limb with the tumor, some healthy tissue above it, and everything below it. In the past, amputation was the main way to treat bone cancers in the arms or legs. Now, this operation is only needed if there's a reason not to do limb-salvage surgery. For example, an amputation may be needed if removing all of the cancer also means removing key nerves, arteries, or muscles that would leave the limb without good function.</p>
<p>MRI scans and examination of the tissue by the pathologist at the time of surgery can help the surgeon decide how much of the arm or leg needs to be removed. Surgery is planned so that muscles and the skin will form a cuff around the amputated bone. This cuff fits into the end of an artificial limb (or prosthesis). After surgery, a person must learn how to use the prosthesis in rehabilitation. With proper physical therapy, people are often walking again 3 to 6 months after leg amputation.</p>
<h3>Limb-salvage surgery</h3>
<p>The goal of limb-salvage surgery is to remove all of the cancer and still leave a working leg or arm. Most patients with bone cancer in a limb are able to have their limb spared. This type of surgery is very complex and requires surgeons with special skills and experience. The challenge for the surgeon is to remove the entire tumor while still saving the nearby tendons, nerves, and vessels. This is not always possible. If a cancer has grown into these structures, they will need to be removed along with the tumor. This can sometimes result in a limb that's painful or can't be used. In that case, amputation may be the best option.</p>
<p>In limb-salvage surgery, a wide-excision is done to remove the tumor. A bone graft or an <strong>endoprosthesis</strong><em> </em>( meaning internal prosthesis) is used to replace the bone that's lost. Endoprostheses are made of metal and other materials. Some used in growing children can be made longer without any extra surgery as the child grows.</p>
<p>Further surgery could be needed if the bone graft or endoprosthesis becomes infected, loose, or broken. Limb-salvage surgery patients may need more surgery over the next 5 years, and at some point may need an amputation.</p>
<p>Rehab is much more intense after limb-salvage surgery than it is after amputation. It takes about a year for patients to learn to walk again after limb-salvage of a leg. If the patient does not take part in the rehabilitation program, the salvaged arm or leg could become useless.</p>
<h3>Reconstructive surgery</h3>
<p>After amputation, surgery can be done to rebuild or reconstruct a new limb. For instance, if the leg must be amputated mid-thigh, the lower leg and foot can be rotated and attached to the thigh bone. The old ankle joint then becomes the new knee joint. This surgery is called<strong>rotationplasty</strong>. A prosthesis is used to make the new leg the same length as the other (healthy) leg.</p>
<p>If the bone tumor is located in the upper arm, the tumor may be removed and then the lower arm attached again. This leaves the patient with an arm that works but is much shorter.</p>
<h2>Tumors in other areas</h2>
<p>Bone cancer in the pelvis is treated with a wide-excision when possible. If needed, bone grafts can be used to rebuild the pelvic bones.</p>
<p>For a tumor in the lower jaw bone, the entire lower half of the jaw may be removed and later replaced with bones from other parts of the body.</p>
<p>For tumors in areas like the spine or the skull, it may not be possible to safely do a wide-excision. Cancers in these bones may require a combination of treatments such as curettage, cryosurgery, and radiation.</p>
<h3>Curettage</h3>
<p>In curettage, the doctor scrapes out the tumor without removing a section of the bone. This leaves a hole in the bone. In some cases, after most of the tumor has been removed, the surgeon will treat the nearby bone tissue to kill any remaining tumor cells. This can be done with cryosurgery or by using bone cement.</p>
<h3>Cryosurgery</h3>
<p>For this treatment, liquid nitrogen is poured into the hole that's left in the bone after the tumor was removed. This extreme cold kills tumor cells by freezing them. This treatment is also called <strong>cryotherapy</strong>. After cryosurgery, the hole in the bone can be filled by bone grafts or with bone cement.</p>
<h3>Bone cement</h3>
<p>The bone cement PMMA (polymethylmethyacrylate) starts out as a liquid and hardens over time. It's put into the hole in the bone in liquid form. As it hardens, it gives off a lot of heat. The heat helps kill any remaining tumor cells. This allows PMMA to be used without cryosurgery for some types of bone tumors.</p>
<h2>Surgical treatment of metastasis</h2>
<p>To be able to cure a bone cancer, it and any existing metastases must be removed completely with surgery. The lungs are the most common site of distant spread for bone cancer. Surgery to remove bone cancer metastases to the lungs must be planned very carefully. Before the operation, the surgeon will consider the number of tumors, where they are (in one lung or both lungs), their size, and the person's overall health.</p>
<p>The chest CT scan might not show all the tumors. The surgeon will have a treatment plan ready just in case more tumors are found during the operation than can be seen on the chest CT scan.</p>
<p>Removing all the lung metastases is probably the only chance for a cure. Still, not all lung metastases can be removed. Some tumors are too big or are too close to important structures in the chest (such as large blood vessels) to be removed safely. People whose general health is not good (due to poor nutritional status or problems with the heart, liver, or kidneys) may not be able to deal with the stress of anesthesia and surgery to remove metastases.</p>

<h1>Radiation Therapy for Bone Cancer</h1>

<p> </p>

<p>Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays or particles to kill cancer cells.<strong> External beam radiation therapy</strong><em> </em>is radiation delivered from outside the body that's focused on the cancer. This is the type of radiation therapy used to treat bone cancer.</p>
<p>Most bone cancers are not easily killed by radiation, and high doses are needed. High doses, however, can damage nearby healthy tissues, as well as key structures (like nerves and blood vessels) in the area. This is why radiation therapy is not used as a main treatment for most types of bone tumors. (It is often used for Ewing tumors.)</p>
<p>Most of the time, radiation is used to treat bone cancers that are<strong> unresectable</strong>. This means they cannot be completely removed with surgery.</p>
<p>Radiation may also be used after surgery if cancer cells were found in the edges (margin) of the removed tissue. Another term for this is <strong>positive margins</strong>. (This is discussed in the section about surgery.) In this case, radiation may be given to kill any cancer that may have been left behind.</p>
<p>If bone cancer comes back after treatment, radiation can help control symptoms like pain and swelling.</p>
<h2>Types of radiation therapy</h2>
<p>Special types of radiation are most commonly used to treat bone cancer. These types give doctors the best control over the size and strength of the radiation beams so that higher doses get to the tumor and spare the nearby tissues.</p>
<h3>Intensity-modulated radiation therapy</h3>
<p>Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an advanced form of external beam radiation therapy. With this technique, a computer matches the radiation beams to the shape of the tumor and can adjust the intensity (strength) of the beams. The radiation is delivered to the tumor from many directions to reduce the amount of radiation that goes through any one area of normal tissue. This makes it possible to reduce radiation damage to normal tissues while increasing the radiation dose to the cancer.</p>
<h3>Proton-beam radiation</h3>
<p>Proton-beam radiation is a special form of radiation that uses protons instead of regular x-rays to kill cancer cells. Protons are positively charged particles that are found inside all atoms. They cause little damage to the tissues they pass through but are very good at killing cells at the end of their path. This allows a high dose of radiation to be given to the tumor without hurting the normal tissue around it. Proton-beam radiation therapy requires highly specialized equipment and is not available at all medical centers. This form of radiation is very helpful in treating skull, spine, rib, or sternum (breast bone) chondrosarcomas and chordomas.</p>
<h3>Extracorporeal radiation</h3>
<p>Though not commonly used, another option is extracorporeal radiation. This may be used when trying to save a limb as part of limb-salvage surgery. It involves taking the bone with cancer out of the body, treating it with radiation, and then putting it back in.</p>
<p>Side effects linked to this include wound healing problems, loss of joint movement, change in limb length, and fractures (breaks) in the treated piece of bone.</p>
<h2>Side effects</h2>
<p>Side effects of radiation therapy depend on what area of the body is being treated and how much radiation is used. Common side effects include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fatigue (tiredness)</li>
    <li>Loss of appetite</li>
    <li>Skin changes in the area being treated, ranging from redness and hair loss to blistering and peeling</li>
    <li>Low blood counts</li>
    <li>Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (these are more common if radiation is given to the belly)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Chemotherapy for Bone Cancer</h1>

<p> </p>

<p>Chemotherapy (chemo) is the use of drugs to treat cancer. Chemo is <strong>systemic</strong><em> </em>treatment. This means that the drugs go into the bloodstream and circulate to reach and destroy cancer cells all over the body.</p>
<p>Chemo is often a part of treatment for osteosarcoma.</p>
<p>It isn't used often for other bone cancers, like giant cell tumors, chordomas, and chondrosarcomas. These types aren't very sensitive to chemo, so it doesn't work well. It can be useful for a certain type of chondrosarcoma called mesenchymal and high-grade dedifferentiated chordomas. It may be used along with targeted therapy for some giant cell tumors.</p>
<p>Chemo is sometimes used for bone cancer that has spread through the bloodstream to the lungs and/or other organs.</p>
<h2>Commonly used chemo drugs</h2>
<p>The drugs mainly used to treat bone cancer include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Doxorubicin (Adriamycin)</li>
    <li>Cisplatin</li>
    <li>Etoposide (VP-16)</li>
    <li>Ifosfamide (Ifex)</li>
    <li>Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan)</li>
    <li>Methotrexate</li>
    <li>Vincristine (Oncovin)</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, several drugs (2 or 3) are given together.</p>
<h2>Side effects of chemotherapy</h2>
<p>Chemo kills cancer cells, but it also damages some normal cells. You will be closely watched during treatment and your team will try to prevent or limit side effects. The side effects of chemo depend on the type of drugs, the doses used, and the length of time they're taken.</p>
<p>Some common short-term side effects include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
    <li>Loss of appetite</li>
    <li>Hair loss</li>
    <li>Mouth sores</li>
</ul>
<p>It's important to tell your cancer care team about any side effects you have so they can be treated.</p>
<p>Chemotherapy can damage the blood-producing cells in the bone marrow, so you may have low blood cell counts. Low blood cell counts can result in:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Increased chance of infection (too few white blood cells)</li>
    <li>Easy bleeding or bruising after minor cuts or injuries (too few platelets)</li>
    <li>Fatigue or shortness of breath (too few red blood cells)</li>
</ul>
<p>While you're getting chemo, your doctor will order lab tests to be sure your blood cell counts are at safe levels.</p>
<p>Some side effects are linked to certain drugs. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ifosfamide</strong> and <strong>cyclophosphamide</strong> can damage the lining of the bladder and cause bloody urine. This is called <strong>hemorrhagic cystitis</strong><em>.</em> It can be prevented by giving a drug called mesna along with the chemo.</li>
    <li><strong>Cisplatin</strong><em> </em>may cause nerve damage (called peripheral neuropathy) leading to problems with numbness, tingling, and even pain in the hands and feet. Kidney damage (called nephropathy) can also occur after treatment with cisplatin. Giving lots of fluid before and after the drug is infused can help prevent this. Cisplatin can sometimes cause problems with hearing (known as ototoxicity). Most often patients with this problem notice they have trouble hearing high-pitched sounds. Your doctor may have you get a hearing test (called an audiogram) before giving cisplatin.</li>
    <li>Over time, <strong>doxorubicin</strong> can damage the heart. The risk of this goes up as the total amount of the drug given goes up. Before giving doxorubicin, your doctor may test your heart function to make sure that it's safe to give you this drug.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's important to note that many of the serious side effects are rare, but they can happen. Talk with your cancer care team so you know what to expect from the chemo you're getting.</p>
<p>The doctors and nurses will watch closely for side effects. There are treatments for most side effects, but preventing them is important. Most side effects, if not all of them, will go away over time after treatment is over. Do not hesitate to ask your cancer care team any questions about side effects.</p>
