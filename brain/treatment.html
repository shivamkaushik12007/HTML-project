<h1>Surgery for Adult Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors</h1>

<p>Surgery on brain and spinal cord tumors may be done to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Get a biopsy sample to determine the type of tumor</li>
    <li>Remove the tumor (or as much of it as possible)</li>
    <li>Help prevent or treat symptoms or possible complications from the tumor</li>
</ul>
<p>Before surgery, be sure you understand the goal of the surgery, as well as its possible benefits and risks.</p>
<h2>Surgery to remove the tumor</h2>
<p>Most often, the first step in brain tumor treatment is for the neurosurgeon to remove as much of the tumor as is safe without affecting normal brain function.</p>
<p>Surgery alone or combined with radiation therapy may control or cure many tumors, including some low-grade astrocytomas, ependymomas, craniopharyngiomas, gangliogliomas, and meningiomas.</p>
<p>Tumors that tend to spread widely into nearby brain tissue such as anaplastic astrocytomas or glioblastomas cannot be cured by surgery. But surgery can reduce the amount of tumor that needs to be treated by radiation or chemotherapy, which might help these treatments work better. This could help prolong the person's life even if all of the tumor can't be removed.</p>
<p>Surgery can also help relieve some of the symptoms caused by brain tumors, particularly those caused by a buildup of pressure within the skull. These can include headaches, nausea, vomiting, and blurred vision. Surgery may also make seizures easier to control with medicines.</p>
<p>Surgery may not be a good option in some situations, such as if the tumor is deep within the brain, if it's in a part of the brain that can't be removed, such as the brain stem, or if a person can't have a major operation for other health reasons.</p>
<p>Surgery is not very effective against some types of brain tumors, such as lymphomas, although it may be used to get a biopsy for diagnosis.</p>
<h3>Craniotomy</h3>
<p>A craniotomy is a surgical opening made in the skull. This is the most common approach for surgery to treat brain tumors. The person may either be under general anesthesia (in a deep sleep) or may be awake for at least part of the procedure (with the surgical area numbed) if brain function needs to be assessed during the operation.</p>
<p>Part of the head might need to be shaved before surgery. The neurosurgeon first makes a cut in the scalp over the skull near the tumor, and folds back the skin. A special type of drill is used to remove the piece of the skull over the tumor.</p>
<p>The opening is typically large enough for the surgeon to insert several instruments and see the parts of the brain needed to operate safely. The surgeon may need to cut into the brain itself to reach the tumor. The surgeon might use MRI or CT scans taken before the surgery (or may use ultrasound once the skull has been opened) to help locate the tumor and its edges.</p>
<p>The surgeon can remove the tumor in different ways depending on how hard or soft it is, and whether it has many or just a few blood vessels:</p>
<ul>
    <li>One way is to cut it out with a scalpel or special scissors.</li>
    <li>Some tumors are soft and can be removed with suction devices.</li>
    <li>In other cases, a probe attached to an ultrasonic generator can be placed into the tumor to break it up and liquefy it. A small vacuum device is then used to suck it out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many devices can help the surgeon see the tumor and surrounding brain tissue. The surgeon often operates while looking at the brain through a special microscope. MRI or CT scans can be done before surgery (or ultrasound can be used once the skull has been opened) to map the area of tumors deep in the brain. In some cases, the surgeon uses <strong>intraoperative imaging</strong>, in which MRI (or other) images are taken at different times during the operation to show the location of any remaining tumor. This may allow some brain tumors to be resected more safely and extensively.</p>
<p>As much of the tumor is removed as possible without affecting important brain tissue or leaving the patient disabled in any way. The surgeon can use different techniques to lower the risk of removing vital parts of the brain, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Intraoperative cortical stimulation (cortical mapping):</strong> In this approach, the surgeon electrically stimulates parts of the brain in and around the tumor during the operation and monitors the response. This can show if these areas control an important function (and therefore should be avoided).</li>
    <li><strong>Functional MRI:</strong> This type of imaging test (described in Tests for Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors in Adults) can be done before surgery to locate a particular function of the brain. This information can be used to identify and preserve that region during the operation.</li>
    <li><strong>Newer techniques:</strong> Newer types of MRI, as well as other techniques such as fluorescence-guided surgery, might be helpful in some situations. Some of these are described in What's New in Adult Brain and Spinal Cord Tumor Research and Treatment?</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the tumor is removed, the piece of the skull bone is put back in place and fastened with metal screws and plates, wires, or special stitches. (Usually any metal pieces are made from titanium, which allows a person to get follow-up MRIs [and will not set off metal detectors].)</p>
<p>You might have small tube (called a drain) coming out of the incision that allows excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to leave the skull. Other drains may be in place to allow blood that builds up after surgery to drain from under the scalp. The drains are usually removed after a few days. An imaging test such as an MRI or CT scan is typically done 1 to 3 days after the operation to confirm how much of the tumor has been removed. Recovery time in the hospital is usually 4 to 6 days, although this depends on the size and location of the tumor, the patient's general health, and whether other treatments are given. Healing around the surgery site usually takes several weeks.</p>
<h2>Surgery to put in a shunt or ventricular access catheter</h2>
<p>If a tumor blocks the flow of the CSF, it can increase pressure inside the skull. This can cause symptoms like headaches, nausea, and drowsiness, and may even be life-threatening.</p>
<p>To drain excess CSF and lower the pressure, the neurosurgeon may put in a silicone tube called a <strong>shunt</strong> (sometimes referred to as a <strong>ventriculoperitoneal or VP shunt</strong>). One end of the shunt is placed in a ventricle of the brain (an area filled with CSF) and the other end is placed in the abdomen or, less often, the heart or other areas. The tube runs under the skin of the neck and chest. The flow of CSF is controlled by a valve placed along the tubing.</p>
<p>Shunts may be temporary or permanent. They can be placed before or after the surgery to remove the tumor. Placing a shunt normally takes about an hour. As with any operation, complications might develop, such as bleeding or infection. Strokes are possible as well. Sometimes shunts get clogged and need to be replaced. The hospital stay after shunt procedures is typically 1 to 3 days, depending on the reason it is placed and the patient's general health.</p>
<p>Surgery may also be used to insert a <strong>ventricular access catheter</strong>, such as an Ommaya reservoir, to help deliver chemotherapy directly into the CSF. A small incision is made in the scalp, and a small hole is drilled in the skull. A flexible tube is then threaded through the hole until the open end of the tube is in a ventricle, where it reaches the CSF. The other end, which has a dome-shaped reservoir, stays just under the scalp. After the operation, doctors and nurses can use a thin needle to give chemotherapy drugs through the reservoir or to remove CSF from the ventricle for testing.</p>
<h2>Possible risks and side effects of surgery</h2>
<p>Surgery on the brain or spinal cord is a serious operation, and surgeons are very careful to try to limit any problems either during or after surgery. Complications during or after surgery such as bleeding, infections, or reactions to anesthesia are rare, but they can happen.</p>
<p>A major concern after surgery is swelling in the brain. Drugs called corticosteroids are typically given before and for several days after surgery to help lessen this risk.</p>
<p>One of the biggest concerns when removing brain tumors is the possible loss of brain function afterward, which is why doctors are very careful to remove only as much tissue as is safely possible. If problems do arise, it could be right after surgery, or it could be days or even weeks later, so close monitoring for any changes is very important (see Living as a Brain or Spinal Cord Tumor Survivor).</p>

<h1>Radiation Therapy for Adult Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors</h1>

<p>Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays or small particles to kill cancer cells. This type of treatment is given by a doctor called a <em>radiation oncologist</em>. Radiation therapy may be used in different situations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>After surgery to try to kill any remaining tumor cells</li>
    <li>As the main treatment if surgery is not a good option and medicines are not effective</li>
    <li>To help prevent or relieve symptoms from the tumor</li>
</ul>
<h2>Types of radiation therapy</h2>
<p>Most often, the radiation is focused on the tumor from a source outside the body. This is called <strong>external beam radiation therapy (EBRT)</strong>. This type of radiation therapy is much like getting an x-ray, but the dose of radiation is much higher.</p>
<p>Before your treatments start, the radiation team will determine the correct angles for aiming the radiation beams and the proper dose of radiation. This planning session, called <strong>simulation</strong>, usually includes getting imaging tests such as CT or MRI scans.</p>
<p>In most cases, the total dose of radiation is divided into daily fractions (usually given Monday through Friday) over several weeks. At each treatment session, you lie on a special table while a machine delivers the radiation from precise angles. The treatment is not painful. Each session lasts about 15 to 30 minutes. Much of that time is spent making sure the radiation is aimed correctly. The actual treatment time each day is much shorter.</p>
<p>High doses of radiation therapy can damage normal brain tissue, so doctors try to deliver the radiation to the tumor with the lowest possible dose to normal surrounding brain areas. Several techniques can help doctors focus the radiation more precisely:</p>
<p><strong>Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT):</strong> 3D-CRT uses the results of imaging tests such as MRI and special computers to map the location of the tumor precisely. Several radiation beams are then shaped and aimed at the tumor from different directions. Each beam alone is fairly weak, which makes it less likely to damage normal tissues, but the beams converge at the tumor to give a higher dose of radiation there.</p>
<p><strong>Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT):</strong> IMRT is an advanced form of 3D therapy. It uses a computer-driven machine that moves around the patient as it delivers radiation. Along with shaping the beams and aiming them at the tumor from several angles, the intensity (strength) of the beams can be adjusted to limit the dose reaching the most sensitive normal tissues. This may let the doctor deliver a higher dose to the tumor. Many major hospitals and cancer centers now use IMRT.</p>
<p><strong>Conformal proton beam radiation therapy:</strong> Proton beam therapy uses an approach similar to 3D-CRT. But instead of using x-rays, it focuses proton beams on the tumor. Protons are positive parts of atoms. Unlike x-rays, which release energy both before and after they hit their target, protons cause little damage to tissues they pass through and then release their energy after traveling a certain distance. Doctors can use this property to deliver more radiation to the tumor and do less damage to nearby normal tissues.</p>
<p>This approach may be more helpful for brain tumors that have distinct edges (such as chordomas), but it is not clear if it will be useful for tumors that are infiltrative or mixed with normal brain tissue (such as astrocytomas or glioblastomas). There are a limited number of proton beam centers in the United States at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)/stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT):</strong> This type of treatment delivers a large, precise radiation dose to the tumor area in a single session (SRS) or in a few sessions (SRT). (There is no actual surgery in this treatment.) It may be used for some tumors in parts of the brain or spinal cord that can't be treated with surgery or when a patient isn't healthy enough for surgery.</p>
<p>First, a head frame is usually attached to the skull to help aim the radiation beams. (Sometimes a face mask is used to hold the head in place instead.) Once the exact location of the tumor is found on CT or MRI scans, radiation is focused at the tumor from many different angles. This can be done in 2 ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>In one approach, radiation beams are focused at the tumor from hundreds of different angles for a short period of time. Each beam alone is weak, but they all converge at the tumor to give a higher dose of radiation. An example of such a machine is the Gamma Knife.</li>
    <li>Another approach uses a movable linear accelerator (a machine that creates radiation) that is controlled by a computer. Instead of delivering many beams at once, this machine moves around the head to deliver radiation to the tumor from many different angles. Several machines with names such as X-Knife, CyberKnife, and Clinac deliver stereotactic radiosurgery in this way.</li>
</ul>
<p>SRS typically delivers the whole radiation dose in a single session, though it may be repeated if needed. For SRT (sometimes called <strong>fractionated sadiosurgery)</strong>, doctors give the radiation in several treatments to deliver the same or a slightly higher dose. Frameless techniques are now available to make this more comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Brachytherapy (internal radiation therapy): </strong>Unlike the external radiation approaches above, brachytherapy involves inserting radioactive material directly into or near the tumor. The radiation it gives off travels a very short distance, so it affects only the tumor. This technique is most often used along with external radiation. It provides a high dose of radiation at the tumor site, while the external radiation treats nearby areas with a lower dose.</p>
<p><strong>Whole brain and spinal cord radiation therapy (craniospinal radiation):</strong> If tests like an MRI scan or lumbar puncture find the tumor has spread along the covering of the spinal cord (meninges) or into the surrounding cerebrospinal fluid, then radiation may be given to the whole brain and spinal cord. Some tumors such as ependymomas and medulloblastomas are more likely to spread this way and often require craniospinal radiation.</p>
<h2>Possible side effects of radiation therapy</h2>
<p>Radiation is more harmful to tumor cells than it is to normal cells. Still, radiation can also damage normal brain tissue, which can lead to side effects.</p>
<p><strong>Side effects during or soon after treatment:</strong> Some people become irritable and tired during the course of radiation therapy. Nausea, vomiting, and headaches are also possible side effects but are uncommon. Sometimes dexamethasone (a corticosteroid) or other drugs can help relieve these symptoms. Some people might have hair loss in areas of the scalp that get radiation. Other side effects are also possible, depending on where the radiation is aimed.</p>
<p><strong>Problems with thinking and memory:</strong> A person may lose some brain function if large areas of the brain get radiation. Problems can include memory loss, personality changes, and trouble concentrating. There may also be other symptoms depending on the area of brain treated and how much radiation was given. These risks must be balanced against the risks of not using radiation and having less control of the tumor.</p>
<p><strong>Radiation necrosis:</strong> Rarely after radiation therapy, a mass of dead (necrotic) tissue forms at the site of the tumor in the months or years after radiation treatment. It can often be controlled with corticosteroid drugs, but surgery may be needed to remove the necrotic tissue in some instances.</p>
<p><strong>Increased risk of another tumor:</strong> Radiation can damage genes in normal cells. As a result, there is a small risk of developing a second cancer in an area that got radiation, for example, a meningioma of the coverings of the brain, another brain tumor, or less likely a bone cancer in the skull. If this occurs, it's usually many years after the radiation is given. This small risk should not prevent those who need radiation from getting treatment.</p>
