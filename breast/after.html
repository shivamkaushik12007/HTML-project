<center><h1>After Treatment</h1></center>
<h1>Emotions and Breast Cancer</h1>
<p>During your treatment, you may find yourself overwhelmed by many different emotions. This happens to a lot of women. Some amount of depression, anxiety, and fear is normal when breast cancer is a part of your life. A certain amount of distress is normal as well. Some women are affected more than others. But everyone can benefit from help and support from other people, whether friends and family, religious groups, support groups, professional counselors, or others.</p>

<p>Emotional issues can arise after treatment as well. For example, you'll probably be concerned that the cancer might come back. Maybe you're more aware of the effects the cancer has had on your family, friends, and career. You may take a new look at your relationships with those around you. Unexpected issues might also cause concern. For instance, you might be stressed by financial concerns resulting from your treatment. You might also see your health care team less often after treatment and have more time on your hands. Any of these things might make you anxious.</p>

<h2>Special issues women with breast cancer face</h2>
<p>Many women with breast cancer face additional stressful issues. For example, your appearance might have changed as a result of breast cancer surgery. You may also have concerns about sexuality after breast cancer. For more on these topics, see Body Image and Sexuality After Breast Cancer.</p>

<p>For younger breast cancer survivors, changes in appearance and sexuality might be even more stressful. Some women might still be thinking about starting a family or having more children, and might worry about how the cancer and its treatment might affect this. Others might have already started families and might worry about how this could affect them. For some women, chemotherapy can cause early menopause, which can be very distressing on its own.</p>

<p>Regardless of the changes you experience, it's important to know that there is advice and support out there to help you cope.</p>

<h2>Finding help and support</h2>
<p>Almost everyone who is going through or has been through cancer can benefit from some type of support. You need people you can turn to for strength and comfort. Support can come in many forms: family, friends, cancer support groups, religious or spiritual groups, online support communities, or one-on-one counselors. What's best for you depends on your situation and personality. Some people feel safe in peer-support groups or education groups. Others would rather talk in an informal setting, such as church. Others may feel more at ease talking one-on-one with a trusted friend or counselor. Whatever your source of strength or comfort, make sure you have a place to go with your concerns.</p>

<p>There are many support groups available, such as the American Cancer Society Reach To Recovery program. This program matches you with a local volunteer who has had breast cancer. As someone who’s been through the experience, your Reach To Recovery volunteer can answer many of your questions.</p>

<p>The cancer journey can feel very lonely. You shouldn’t feel the need to try to deal with everything on your own, and your friends and family may feel shut out if you don’t include them. Let them in, and let in anyone else who you feel may help.</p>

<p>If you aren't sure who can help, call your American Cancer Society at 1-800-227-2345 and we can put you in touch with a group or resource that may work for you.</p>


    <h1>Body Image and Sexuality After Breast Cancer</h1>
    <p>Learning to be comfortable with your body during and after breast cancer treatment is a personal journey, one that is different for every woman. Information and support can help you cope with these changes over time.</p>
    <h2>Feeling good about your body during and after breast cancer treatment</h2>
    <p>Along with the emotional stress that cancer and its treatment can cause, many women with breast cancer also find themselves coping with changes in their appearance as a result of their treatment.</p>
    <p>Some changes may be short term, such as hair loss. But even short-term changes can have a profound effect on how a woman feels about herself. A number of options are available to help you cope with hair loss, including wigs, hats, scarves, and other accessories. Alternatively, some women choose to use their baldness as a way to identify themselves as breast cancer survivors.</p>
    <p>Other changes are more permanent, like the loss of part or all of a breast (or breasts) after surgery. Some women choose to have reconstructive surgery to rebuild the breast mound. If you decide not to have breast reconstruction, you can decide whether to wear a breast form or prosthesis or not.</p>
    <h2>Sexuality after breast cancer</h2>
    <p>You may have concerns about sexuality after breast cancer. Physical changes, especially after breast surgery, can make some women less comfortable with their bodies. There may be a loss of sensation in the affected breast. Other treatments for breast cancer, such as chemotherapy, can change your hormone levels and may affect your sexual interest and/or response.</p>
    <p>Relationship issues are also important. Your partner may worry about how to express love physically and emotionally after treatment, especially after surgery. But breast cancer can be a growth experience for couples &ndash; especially when partners take part in decision-making and go along to treatments.</p>

    <h2>Finding help and support</h2>
    <p>Regardless of the changes you may experience, it's important to know that there is advice and support out there to help you cope with them. Speaking with your doctor or other members of your health care team is often a good starting point. There are also many support groups available, such as the >American Cancer Society Reach To Recovery program. This program matches you up with a local volunteer who has had breast cancer. Your Reach To Recovery volunteer can answer many of your questions. She can give you suggestions, additional reading material, and advice. Remember that she's been there and will probably understand.</p>
    <p>Some studies suggest that younger women, who represent about 1 out of 9 breast cancer survivors , tend to have more problems adjusting to the stresses of breast cancer and its treatment. It can feel socially isolating. Younger women may also be more affected by issues of sexuality or fertility. If you are having trouble adjusting after a breast cancer diagnosis, look for a counselor or a support group directed at younger breast cancer survivors.</p>


        <p>Many women are able to become pregnant after treatment for breast cancer. However, some treatments can make it harder to get pregnant. If you think you may want to have children one day, or just want to keep your options open, the best time to talk to your doctor about fertility is before you begin breast cancer treatment.</p>
        <p>Breast cancer is most common in older women. But if you are a younger woman who has had breast cancer, you might have questions about how breast cancer could affect your ability to have children and whether there are any extra risks.</p>
        <h2>Can I have a baby after having breast cancer?</h2>
        <p>Some treatments for breast cancer may affect a woman&rsquo;s fertility (ability to have a baby). For example, chemotherapy for breast cancer might damage the ovaries, which can sometimes cause immediate or delayed infertility. Still, many women are able to become pregnant after treatment. The best time to talk with your doctor about fertility is <strong>before</strong> starting breast cancer treatment. For more about how cancer treatment can affect fertility, see Fertility and Women With Cancer.</p>
        <h2>Could pregnancy and breastfeeding make my breast cancer come back?</h2>
        <p>Many breast cancers are sensitive to estrogen, so there has been concern that for women who have had breast cancer, the high hormone levels that result from a pregnancy might increase the chance of the cancer coming back. Studies have shown, though, that pregnancy does not increase the risk of the cancer coming back after successful treatment.</p>
        <p>There&rsquo;s also no proof that breastfeeding after breast cancer treatment increases the risk of recurrence. In fact, some research suggests having a history of breastfeeding might actually lower the risk of the cancer coming back.</p>
        <h2>How long after breast cancer treatment should I wait before becoming pregnant?</h2>
        <p>If you want to have children, some doctors advise breast cancer survivors to wait at least 2 years after all treatment has finished before trying to get pregnant. The best length of time to wait is not clear, but 2 years is thought to be enough time to find any early return of the cancer, which could affect your decision to become pregnant. Keep in mind that this advice is not based on data from any clinical trials. And some breast cancers can come back after the 2-year mark, so every case is different. Your decision should be based on many things, including your age, desire for more pregnancies, type of breast cancer, and the risk of the cancer coming back early.</p>
        <h2>If I get pregnant, would my history of breast cancer put my baby at risk?</h2>
        <p>There is no proof that a woman&rsquo;s past breast cancer has any direct effect on her baby. Researchers have found no increased rate of birth defects or other long-term health concerns in children born to women who have had breast cancer.</p>
        <h2>Could breast cancer treatment affect my unborn baby?</h2>
        <p>If you are still getting any type of treatment for breast cancer, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or targeted therapy, talk to your doctor before trying to become pregnant. These drugs could affect a growing fetus, so it is safer to wait until all treatment is complete before getting pregnant. It&rsquo;s also important to remember that stopping treatment early can increase the risk of the cancer growing or coming back. See Treating Breast Cancer During Pregnancy for more on this.</p>
        <h2>Can I breastfeed after breast cancer treatment?</h2>
        <p>If you have had breast surgery and/or radiation, you may have problems breastfeeding from the affected breast. Studies have shown reduced milk production in that breast as well as structural changes that can make breastfeeding painful, or make it difficult for the baby to latch onto the breast. Still, many women are able to breastfeed.</p>
        <p>If you are still taking any medicines to treat your breast cancer (such as hormone therapy), it&rsquo;s very important to talk with your doctor before trying to breastfeed. Some drugs can enter the breast milk and might affect the baby.</p>
        <h2>Talk to your doctor</h2>
        <p>If you have or have had breast cancer and are thinking about having children, talk with your doctor about how treatment could affect your chances for pregnancy. This discussion should also cover the risk of the cancer coming back. In many cases, counseling can help you sort through the choices that come with surviving breast cancer and planning a pregnancy.</p>
