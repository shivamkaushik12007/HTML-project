                    <h1>American Cancer Society Recommendations for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer</h1>

                    <p>Finding breast cancer early and getting state-of-the-art cancer treatment are the most important strategies to prevent deaths from breast cancer. Breast cancer that's found early, when it's small and has not spread, is easier to treat successfully. Getting regular screening tests is the most reliable way to find breast cancer early. The American Cancer Society has screening guidelines for women at average risk of breast cancer, and for those at high risk for breast cancer.</p>
                    <h2>What are screening tests?</h2>
                    <p>The goal of screening tests for breast cancer is to find it before it causes symptoms (like a lump that can be felt). <strong>Screening</strong> refers to tests and exams used to find a disease in people who don't have any symptoms. <strong>Early detection </strong>means finding and diagnosing a disease earlier than if you'd waited for symptoms to start.</p>
                    <p>Breast cancers found during screening exams are more likely to be smaller and still confined to the breast. The size of a breast cancer and how far it has spread are some of the most important factors in predicting the <strong>prognosis</strong> (outlook) of a woman with this disease.</p>
                    <h2>American Cancer Society screenings recommendations for women at average breast cancer risk</h2>
                    <p>These guidelines are for women at <strong>average risk</strong> for breast cancer. For screening purposes, a woman is considered to be at average risk if she doesn't have a personal history of breast cancer, a strong family history of breast cancer, or a genetic mutation known to increase risk of breast cancer (such as in a <em>BRCA</em> gene), and has not had chest radiation therapy before the age of 30. (See below for guidelines for women at high risk.)</p>
                    <p><strong>Women between 40 and 44</strong> have the option to start screening with a mammogram every year.</p>
                    <p><strong>Women 45 to 54</strong> should get mammograms every year.</p>
                    <p><strong>Women 55 and older</strong> can switch to a mammogram every other year, or they can choose to continue yearly mammograms. Screening should continue as long as a woman is in good health and is expected to live 10 more years or longer.</p>
                    <p><strong>All women</strong> should understand what to expect when getting a mammogram for breast cancer screening &ndash; what the test can and cannot do.</p>
                    <h3>Mammograms</h3>
                    <p>Regular mammograms can help find breast cancer at an early stage, when treatment is most successful. A mammogram can find breast changes that could be cancer years before physical symptoms develop. Results from many decades of research clearly show that women who have regular mammograms are more likely to have breast cancer found early, are less likely to need aggressive treatment like surgery to remove the breast (mastectomy) and chemotherapy, and are more likely to be cured.</p>
                    <p>Mammograms are not perfect. They miss some cancers. And sometimes a woman will need more tests to find out if something found on a mammogram is or is not cancer. There's also a small possibility of being diagnosed with a cancer that never would have caused any problems had it not been found during screening. It's important that women getting mammograms know what to expect and understand the benefits and limitations of screening.</p>
                    <h3>Clinical breast exam and breast self-exam</h3>
                    <p>Research has not shown a clear benefit of regular physical breast exams done by either a health professional (clinical breast exams) or by yourself (breast self-exams). There is very little evidence that these tests help find breast cancer early when women also get screening mammograms. Most often when breast cancer is detected because of symptoms (such as a lump), a woman discovers the symptom during usual activities such as bathing or dressing. <strong>Women should be familiar with how their breasts normally look and feel and report any changes to a health care provider right away.</strong></p>
                    <h2>American Cancer Society screening recommendations for women at high risk</h2>
                    <p>Women who are at <strong>high risk</strong> for breast cancer based on certain factors should get an MRI and a mammogram every year, typically starting at age 30. This includes women who:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Have a lifetime risk of breast cancer of about 20% to 25% or greater, according to risk assessment tools that are based mainly on family history (see below)</li>
                        <li>Have a known <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> gene mutation (based on having had genetic testing)</li>
                        <li>Have a first-degree relative (parent, brother, sister, or child) with a <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> gene mutation, and have not had genetic testing themselves</li>
                        <li>Had radiation therapy to the chest when they were between the ages of 10 and 30 years</li>
                        <li>Have Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Cowden syndrome, or Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, or have first-degree relatives with one of these syndromes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The American Cancer Society recommends against MRI screening for women whose lifetime risk of breast cancer is less than 15%.</p>
                    <p>There's not enough evidence to make a recommendation for or against yearly MRI screening for women who have a higher lifetime risk based on certain factors , such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Having a personal history of breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), or atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH)</li>
                        <li>Having "extremely" or "heterogeneously" dense breasts as seen on a mammogram</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If MRI is used, it should be in addition to, not instead of, a screening mammogram. This is because although an MRI is more likely to detect cancer than a mammogram, it may still miss some cancers that a mammogram would detect.</p>
                    <p>Most women at high risk should begin screening with MRI and mammograms when they are 30 and continue for as long as they are in good health. But a woman at high risk should make the decision to start with her health care providers, taking into account her personal circumstances and preferences.</p>
                    <h3>Tools used to assess breast cancer risk</h3>
                    <p>Several risk assessment tools are available to help health professionals estimate a woman's breast cancer risk. These tools give approximate, rather than precise, estimates of breast cancer risk based on different combinations of risk factors and different data sets.</p>
                    <p>Because the different tools use different factors to estimate risk, they may give different risk estimates for the same woman. Two models could easily give different estimates for the same person.</p>
                    <p>Risk assessment tools that include family history in first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, and children) and second-degree relatives (such as aunts and cousins) on both sides of the family should be used with the ACS guidelines to decide if a woman should have MRI screening. The use of any of the risk assessment tools and its results should be discussed by a woman with her health care provider.</p>

                                            <h1>Experimental Breast Imaging</h1>
                                            <p>If you have been diagnosed with breast cancer, you might need more tests if your doctor thinks the cancer might have spread based on your symptoms, the results of your physical exam, or the size of your tumor.Your doctor will talk with you about which (if any) of these tests you will need.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Chest x-ray:</strong>This test may be done to see if the cancer has spread to your lungs.</p>
                                            <p><strong>CT scan(computed tomography):</strong><strong></strong>A CT scan uses x-rays taken from different angles, which are combined by a computer to make detailed pictures of the organs. This test is most often used to look at the chest and/or belly (abdomen) to see if breast cancer has spread to other organs. It can also be used to guide a biopsy needle into an area of concern.</p>
                                            <p><strong>MRI(magnetic resonance imaging):</strong>This testmakes detailed pictures using radio waves and strong magnets instead of x-rays. This test can be helpful in looking at your brain and spinal cord. MRIs can be more uncomfortable than CT scans because they take longer and you often need to lie in a narrow tube while the test is done.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Ultrasound:</strong><strong></strong>For an ultrasound, a wand that gives off sound waves is moved over the skin to take pictures of the inside of the body. A gel is often put on your skin first.</p>
                                            <p><strong>PET scan(positron emission tomography):</strong><strong></strong>For this test, a form of radioactive sugar is put into a vein and travels throughout the body. Cancer cells absorb high amounts of this sugar. A special camera then takes pictures that show the areas where the sugar collected throughout the body.A PET scan is often combined with a CT scan (known as a<strong>PET/CT scan</strong>).</p>
                                            <p><strong>Bone scan:</strong><strong></strong>This test can help show if the cancer has spread to your bones. It is similar to a PET scan, but it uses a different radioactive substance that settles in areas of change in the bones. It can show all of the bones of your body at the same time and can find small areas of cancer spread not seen on plain x-rays.</p>

                        <h1>Finding Breast Cancer During Pregnancy</h1>

                        <p>Breast cancer during pregnancy is rare. But if you find a lump or notice any changes in your breasts that concern you, tell your doctor or nurse right away. There are a variety of tests a pregnant woman can have if breast cancer is suspected. And there are options for treating breast cancer if you are pregnant.</p>
                        <p>If you are pregnant and breast cancer is found, it may be called<strong>gestational breast cancer</strong><em></em>or<strong>pregnancy-associated breast cancer</strong><em></em>(PABC)<em>.</em></p>
                        <h2>How common is breast cancer during pregnancy?</h2>
                        <p>Breast cancer is found in about 1 in every 3,000 pregnant women. But it is the most common type of cancer found during pregnancy. </p>
                        <h2>Breast cancers can be harder to find when you're pregnant</h2>
                        <p>Hormone changes during pregnancy cause the breasts to change. They may become larger, lumpy, and/or tender. This can make it harder for you or your doctor to notice a lump caused by cancer until it gets quite large.</p>
                        <p>Another reason it may be hard to find breast cancers early during pregnancy is that many women put off breast cancer screening with mammograms until after the pregnancy. And because pregnancy and breastfeeding can make breast tissue denser, it can be harder to see an early cancer on a mammogram.</p>
                        <p>Because of these challenges, when a pregnant woman develops breast cancer, it's often diagnosed at a later stage than it would be if she were not pregnant. It's also more likely to have spread to lymph nodes.</p>
                        <h2>What to look for</h2>
                        <p>If you find a lump or notice any changes in your breasts that concern you, don't ignore them. Tell your doctor or nurse right away. If your doctor doesn't want to check it out with amammogram, ask about other kinds of imaging tests such as ultrasoundor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). You may need to get a second opinion. Any suspicious breast changes should be checked out or even biopsied (see below) before assuming they are a normal response to pregnancy.</p>
                        <h2>Are mammograms and other imaging tests safe during pregnancy?</h2>
                        <p>A main concern with any imaging test during pregnancy is whether it exposes the developing fetus to radiation, which could be harmful.</p>
                        <p><strong>Mammograms</strong>can find most breast cancers that start when a woman is pregnant, and it's thought to be safe to have a mammogram during pregnancy. The amount of radiation needed for a mammogram is small. And the radiation is focused on the breasts, so that most of it doesn't reach other parts of the body. For extra protection, a lead shield is placed over the lower part of the belly to help keep radiation from reaching the womb. Still, scientists can't be certain about the effects of even a very small dose of radiation on an unborn baby.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ultrasound</strong>exams of the breast do not use radiation and are thought to be safe during pregnancy. This is typically an easy test to have, so it's often the first test done to evaluate a change in the breast (such as a lump).</p>
                        <p><strong>MRI scans</strong>do not use radiation and are thought to be safe during pregnancy. But the contrast material (dye) used in MRI can cross the placenta, the organ that connects the mother to the fetus. This dye has been linked with fetal abnormalities in lab animals. For this reason, many doctors do not recommend MRI with contrast dye during pregnancy. An MRI without contrast can be used if needed.</p>
                        <p>Other tests, such as<strong>PET scans</strong>,<strong>bone scans</strong>, and<strong>computed tomography (CT) scans</strong>are more likely to expose the fetus to radiation (see below).</p>
                        <h2>Breast biopsy during pregnancy</h2>
                        <p>A new lump or abnormal imaging test result may cause concern, but a biopsyis the only way to find out if a breast change is cancer. During a biopsy a small piece of tissue is taken from the area of concern. Breast biopsies are most often done using a needle. They're usually done as an outpatient procedure, even if you're pregnant. The doctor uses medicine to numb just the area of the breast involved in the biopsy. This causes little risk to the fetus.</p>
                        <p>If a needle biopsy doesn't give an answer, a surgical biopsyis typically the next step. This means taking out a piece of tissue through a small cut (incision) in the breast. Surgical biopsies are often done under general anesthesia (where drugs are used to put the patient into a deep sleep), which carries a small risk to the fetus.</p>
                        <h2>Tests to stage the breast cancer</h2>
                        <p>If breast cancer is found, you might need other tests to find out if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of the body. This process is called<strong>staging</strong>. Different staging tests may be needed, depending on your case.</p>
                        <p>As noted above, tests like ultrasound and MRI scans do not use radiation and are thought to be safe during pregnancy. But the contrast material (dye) sometimes used in MRI is typically not recommended during pregnancy. An MRI without contrast can be used if needed.</p>
                        <p>Chest x-rays are sometimes needed to help make treatment decisions. They use a small amount of radiation. They're thought to be safe to have when you're pregnant, as long as your belly is shielded.</p>
                        <p>Other tests, such as PET scans, bone scans, and computed tomography (CT) scans are more likely to expose the fetus to radiation. These tests are not often needed, especially if the cancer is thought to be just in the breast. If one of these tests is needed, doctors might be able to make adjustments to limit the amount of radiation exposure to the fetus.</p>
                        <p>Treatments are available if a pregnant woman has breast cancer. Learn about treating breast cancer during pregnancy.</p>
                        <h2>Can breast cancer spread to the baby?</h2>
                        <p>There are no reported cases of breast cancer spreading from the mother to the fetus. But in a very few cases, the cancer has reached the placenta (the organ that connects the mother to the fetus). This could affect the amount of nutrition the fetus gets from the mother.</p>
