<h1>Surgery to Treat Lung Carcinoid Tumors</h1>

<p> </p>
<div>
    <p>Surgery is the main treatment for lung carcinoid tumors whenever possible. If the tumor hasn't spread, it can often be cured by surgery alone.</p>
    <h2>Types of lung surgery</h2>
    <p>Different operations can be used to treat (and possibly cure) lung carcinoid tumors. These operations require general anesthesia (where you are in a deep sleep) and are usually done through a surgical incision between the ribs in the side of the chest (called a <em>thoracotomy</em>).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pneumonectomy:</strong> An entire lung is removed.</li>
        <li><strong>Lobectomy:</strong> An entire section (lobe) of a lung is removed.</li>
        <li><strong>Segmentectomy or wedge resection:</strong> Part of a lobe is removed.</li>
        <li><strong>Sleeve resection:</strong> Part of a large airway is removed. Picture a tumor in a large airway as a stain on a shirt sleeve, about an inch or two above the wrist. This surgery would be like cutting across the sleeve above and below the stain and sewing the cuff back onto the shortened sleeve. When this surgery can be done instead of a pneumonectomy, more lung function can be preserved.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With any of these operations, nearby lymph nodes are also removed to look for possible spread of the cancer.</p>
    <p>The type of operation your doctor recommends depends on the size and location of the tumor and on how well your lungs are functioning. People whose lungs are healthier can withstand having more lung tissue removed.</p>
    <p>When you wake up from surgery, you will have a tube (or tubes) coming out of your chest and attached to a special canister to allow excess fluid and air to drain out. The tube(s) will be removed once the fluid drainage and air leak slow down. Generally, your time in the hospital after surgery can range from 3 to 7 days depending on the type of surgery that is done.</p>
    <h3>Lymph node sampling</h3>
    <p>With any of these operations, lymph nodes near the lungs are usually removed to look for possible spread of the cancer. This is important because the carcinoid might have spread to lymph nodes by the time it is diagnosed. (This risk is higher for atypical carcinoids than for typical carcinoids.) If the lymph nodes containing cancer are not removed, it will increase the risk of the carcinoid tumor spreading even farther, to other organs. If this happens, you may no longer be able to be cured by surgery. Checking for cancer cells in the lymph nodes can also provide some indication of your risk of the cancer come back.</p>
    <h3>Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS)</h3>
    <p>This is a less invasive type of surgery for some cancers in the lungs. During this operation, a thin, rigid tube with a tiny video camera on the end is placed through a small cut in the side of the chest to help the surgeon see inside the chest. One or two other small cuts are created in the skin, and long instruments are passed though these cuts to do the same operation that would be done using an open approach (thoracotomy). Because only small incisions are needed, there is less pain after the surgery and a shorter hospital stay usually around 4 to 5 days.</p>
    <p>Most experts recommend that only smaller tumors near the outside of the lung be treated this way. The cure rate after this surgery seems to be the same as with surgery done with a larger incision. But it is important that the surgeon doing this operation be experienced because it requires a great deal of technical skill.</p>
    <h2>Possible risks and side effects of lung surgery</h2>
    <p>Possible complications depend on the extent of the surgery and the person's health beforehand. Serious complications can include excessive bleeding, wound infections, and pneumonia.</p>
    <p>Lung surgery is a major operation, and recovering from the operation typically takes weeks to months. If the surgery is done through a thoracotomy, the surgeon must spread the ribs to get to the lung, so the area near the incision will hurt for some time after surgery. Your activity will be limited for at least a month. People who have VATS instead of thoracotomy have less pain after surgery and tend to recover more quickly.</p>
    <p>If your lungs are in good condition (other than the presence of the cancer) you can usually return to normal activities after a lobe or even an entire lung has been removed. If you also have non-cancerous diseases such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis (which are common among heavy smokers), you may become short of breath with activity after surgery.</p>

    <h1>Supportive Procedures for Lung Carcinoid Tumor Symptoms</h1>
    <p> </p>
    <div>
        <p>If you can't have major surgery because your lung function is at a low level or you have other serious medical problems, or if the cancer has spread too much to be removed, other treatments may be used to relieve some symptoms.</p>
        <p>These treatments, called <em>palliative procedures</em>, can relieve symptoms, but they do not cure the cancer and are recommended only if you can't have surgery to completely remove the tumor. If you are treated with these procedures you may also get radiation therapy.</p>
        <h2>Treating airway blockage</h2>
        <p>If the tumor is blocking airways in the lung, it might lead to pneumonia or shortness of breath. Removing most of the tumor through a bronchoscope or destroying most of it with a laser (on the end of a bronchoscope) can be helpful. In some cases, a bronchoscope may be used to place a stent (a stiff tube) made of metal or silicone in the airway after treatment to help keep it open.</p>
        <h2>Treating fluid buildup</h2>
        <p>In rare instances, fluid can build up inside the chest (outside of the lungs), press on the lungs and affect breathing. Usually, a hollow needle is put through the skin and into the pleural space to remove the fluid. (This is known as a <em>thoracentesis</em>.) For most people, removing the fluid can relieve breathing problems right away, but the fluid will often build up again quickly if nothing else is done.</p>
        <h3>Pleurodesis</h3>
        <p>To remove the fluid and keep it from coming back, doctors sometimes do a procedure called <em>pleurodesis</em>. A small cut is made in the skin of the chest wall, and a hollow tube is placed into the chest to remove the fluid. Either talc or a drug such as doxycycline or certain chemotherapy drugs (like bleomycin) is then instilled into the chest cavity. This causes the linings of the lung (visceral pleura) and chest wall (parietal pleura) to stick together, sealing the space and limiting further fluid buildup. The tube is often left in for a day or two to drain any new fluid that might collect.</p>
        <h3>Catheter placement</h3>
        <p>This is another way to control fluid buildup. One end of the catheter (a thin, flexible tube) is placed in the chest through a small cut in the skin, and the other end is left outside the body. This is done in a doctor's office or hospital. Once in place, the catheter can be attached to a special bottle or other device to allow the fluid to drain out on a regular basis.</p>
        <h2>Procedures to relieve symptoms of liver metastases</h2>
        <p>If the cancer spreads to the liver, treating the liver tumors may help with symptoms. When there are only 1 or 2 tumors in the liver, they may be removed with surgery. If there are more than just a few liver tumors (or if a person is too sick for surgery), other techniques may be used.</p>
        <h3>Ablation</h3>
        <p>Ablation techniques destroy tumors without removing them. They are generally not used for large tumors, and are best for tumors no more than about 2 cm (a little less than an inch) across.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Radiofrequency ablation</strong> (RFA) uses high-energy radio waves for treatment. A thin, needle-like probe is placed through the skin and into the tumor. Placement of the probe is guided by ultrasound or CT scans. The tip of the probe releases a high-frequency current that heats the tumor and destroys the cancer cells.</li>
            <li><strong>Ethanol (alcohol) ablation</strong> (also known as <em>percutaneous ethanol injection</em>) kills the cancer cells by injecting concentrated alcohol directly into the tumor. This is usually done through the skin using a needle guided by ultrasound or CT scans.</li>
            <li><strong>Microwave thermotherapy</strong> uses microwaves to heat and destroy cancer cells.</li>
            <li><strong>Cryosurgery (cryotherapy)</strong> destroys a tumor by freezing it with a metal probe. The probe is guided through the skin and into the tumor using ultrasound. Then very cold gasses are passed through the probe to freeze the tumor, killing the cancer cells. This method may be used to treat larger tumors compared to the other ablation techniques, but it sometimes requires general anesthesia (where you are asleep).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Embolization</h3>
        <p><strong>Arterial embolization (also known as <em>transarterial embolization</em> or TAE): </strong>This is<em> </em>another option for tumors that can't be removed completely. It can be used for larger tumors (up to about 5 cm or 2 inches across). This technique reduces the blood flow to the cancer cells by blocking the branch of the hepatic artery feeding the area of the liver containing the tumor. Blood flow is blocked (or reduced) by injecting materials that plug up the artery. Most of the healthy liver cells will not be affected because they get their blood supply from the portal vein.</p>
        <p>In this procedure a catheter is put into an artery in the inner thigh and threaded up into the liver. A dye is then injected into the bloodstream to allow the doctor to monitor the path of the catheter via angiography, a special type of x-ray. Once the catheter is in place, small particles called <em>microspheres</em> are injected into the artery to plug it up.</p>
        <p><strong>Radioembolization:</strong> In the United States, this is done by injecting small radioactive beads into the hepatic artery. The beads travel to the tumor and give off small amounts of radiation only at the tumor sites.</p>

        <h1>Chemotherapy for Lung Carcinoid Tumors</h1>

        <p> </p>
        <p>Chemotherapy (chemo) is the use of anti-cancer drugs that are injected into a vein or taken by mouth. These drugs enter the bloodstream and reach almost all areas of the body, making this treatment useful for some types of lung cancer that have spread to organs beyond the lungs.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, carcinoid tumors usually do not respond very well to chemo. It is mainly used for carcinoid tumors that have spread to other organs, are causing severe symptoms, have not responded to other medicines, or atypical carcinoids that are dividing quickly. Sometimes, it may be given after surgery.</p>
        <p>Because chemo does not always shrink carcinoid tumors, it is important to ask your doctor about the chances of it helping and if the benefits are likely to outweigh the risk of side effects.</p>
        <p>Some of the chemo drugs that may be used for advanced lung carcinoids include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Etoposide (VP-16)</li>
            <li>Cisplatin</li>
            <li>Carboplatin</li>
            <li>Temozolomide</li>
            <li>Oxaliplatin</li>
            <li>5-fluorouracil (5-FU)</li>
            <li>Streptozocin</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Chemo drugs can be used together or alone, and often along with other types of medicines. Frequently used chemo drugs/combinations include carboplatin/etoposide, cisplatin/etoposide, temozolomide, and oxaliplatin .</p>
        <p>Doctors give chemo in cycles, with each period of treatment followed by a rest period to allow the body time to recover. Chemo cycles generally last about 3 to 4 weeks, and initial treatment is typically 4 to 6 cycles. Chemo is often not recommended for patients in poor health, but advanced age by itself is not a barrier to getting chemo.</p>
        <h2>Possible side effects of chemotherapy</h2>
        <p>Chemo drugs attack cells that are dividing quickly, which is why they work against cancer cells. But other cells, such as those in the bone marrow (where new blood cells are made), the lining of the mouth and intestines, and the hair follicles, also divide quickly. These cells are also likely to be affected by chemo, which can lead to side effects.</p>
        <p>The side effects of chemo depend on the type and dose of drugs given and the length of time they are taken. Common side effects can include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hair loss</li>
            <li>Mouth sores</li>
            <li>Loss of appetite</li>
            <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
            <li>Diarrhea or constipation</li>
            <li>Increased chance of infections (from having too few white blood cells)</li>
            <li>Easy bruising or bleeding (from having too few blood platelets)</li>
            <li>Fatigue (from having too few red blood cells)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These side effects usually go away after treatment is finished. There are often ways to avoid or lessen these side effects. For example, drugs can be given to help prevent or reduce nausea and vomiting.</p>
        <p>Some drugs can have other side effects. For example, cisplatin can damage nerve endings (a condition called <em>neuropathy</em>). This may lead to symptoms (mainly in the hands and feet) such as pain, burning or tingling sensations, sensitivity to cold or heat, or weakness. In most cases this goes away once treatment is stopped, but it may last a long time in some people.</p>
        <p>You should tell your medical team about any side effects or changes you notice while getting chemotherapy, so that they can be treated promptly. In some cases, the doses of the chemo drugs may need to be reduced or treatment may need to be delayed or stopped to keep the effects from worsening.</p>
