                                        <h1>Liver Cancer Surgery</h1>
                                            <p>At this time, surgery, either with resection (removal of the tumor) or a liver transplant, offers the only reasonable chance to cure liver cancer. If all cancer in the liver is successfully removed, you will have the best outlook.</p>
                                            <h3>Partial hepatectomy</h3>
                                            <p>Surgery to remove part of the liver is called <em>partial hepatectomy</em>. This operation is considered for a single tumor that has not grown into blood vessels. It is only an option in patients with good liver function who are healthy enough for surgery. Unfortunately, most liver cancers cannot be completely removed. Often the cancer is in too many different parts of the liver, is too large, or has spread beyond the liver.</p>
                                            <p>Imaging tests, such as CT or MRI with angiography are done first to see if the cancer can be removed completely. Still, sometimes during surgery the cancer is found to be too large or spread too far to be removed, and the surgery has to be cancelled.</p>
                                            <p>Most patients with liver cancer in the United States also have cirrhosis. In someone with severe cirrhosis, removing even a small amount of liver tissue at the edges of a cancer might not leave enough liver behind to perform essential functions.</p>
                                            <p>People with cirrhosis are eligible for surgery only if the cancer is small and they still have a reasonable amount of liver function left. Doctors often assess this function by assigning a Child-Pugh score (see Liver Cancer Stages), which is a measure of cirrhosis based on certain lab tests and symptoms.</p>
                                            <p>Patients in class A are most likely to have enough liver function to have surgery. Patients in class B are less likely to be able to have surgery. Surgery is not typically an option for patients in class C.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Possible risks and side effects:</strong> Liver resection is a major, serious operation that should only be done by skilled and experienced surgeons. Because people with liver cancer usually have other liver problems besides the cancer, surgeons have to remove enough of the liver to try to get all of the cancer, yet leave enough behind for the liver to function adequately.</p>
                                            <p>A lot of blood passes through the liver, and bleeding after surgery is a major concern. On top of this, the liver normally makes substances that help the blood clot. Damage to the liver (both before the surgery and during the surgery itself) can add to potential bleeding problems.</p>
                                            <p>Other possible problems are similar to those seen with other major surgeries and can include infections, complications from anesthesia, blood clots, and pneumonia.</p>
                                            <p>Another concern is that because the remaining liver still has the underlying disease that led to the cancer, sometimes a new liver cancer can develop afterward.</p>
                                            <h3>Liver transplant</h3>
                                            <p>When it is available, a liver transplant may be the best option for some people with small liver cancers. Liver transplants can be an option for those with tumors that cannot be removed with surgery, either because of the location of the tumors or because the liver is too diseased for the patient to withstand removing part of it. In general, it is used to treat patients with small tumors (either 1 tumor smaller than 5 cm across or 2 to 3 tumors no larger than 3 cm) that have not invaded nearby blood vessels. It can also rarely be an option for patients with resectable cancers (cancers that can be removed completely).</p>
                                            <p>According to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, about 1,300 liver transplants were done in people with cancer in the liver in the United States in 2012, the last year for which numbers are available. In most cases, the patients had liver cancer but some had bile duct cancer.</p>
                                            <p>With a transplant, not only is the risk of a second new liver cancer significantly reduced, but the new liver will function normally.</p>
                                            <p>Unfortunately, the opportunities for liver transplants are limited. Only about 6,500 livers are available for transplant each year, and most of these are used for patients with diseases other than liver cancer. Increasing awareness about the importance of organ donation is an essential public health goal that could make this treatment available to more patients with liver cancer and other serious liver diseases.</p>
                                            <p>Most livers used for transplants come from people who have just died. But some patients receive part of a liver from a living donor (usually a close relative) for transplant. The liver can regenerate some of its lost function over time if part of it is removed. Still, the surgery does carry some risks for the donor. About 350 living donor liver transplants are done in the United States each year. Only a small number of them are for patients with liver cancer.</p>
                                            <p>People needing a transplant must wait until a liver is available, which can take too long for some people with liver cancer. In many cases a person may get other treatments, such as embolization or ablation (described in following sections), while waiting for a liver transplant. Or doctors may suggest surgery or other treatments first and then a transplant if the cancer comes back.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Possible risks and side effects:</strong> Like partial hepatectomy, a liver transplant is a major operation with serious risks (bleeding, infection, blood clots, complications from anesthesia, etc.). But there are some additional risks after this surgery.</p>
                                            <p>People who get a liver transplant are given drugs to help suppress their immune systems to prevent their bodies from rejecting the new organ. These drugs have their own risks and side effects, especially the risk of getting serious infections. By suppressing the immune system, these drugs might also allow any liver cancer that had spread outside of the liver to grow even faster than before. Some of the drugs used to prevent rejection can also cause high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes; can weaken the bones and kidneys; and can even lead to a new cancer.</p>
                                            <p>After a liver transplant, regular blood tests are done to check for signs of the body rejecting the new liver. Sometimes liver biopsies are also taken to see if rejection is occurring and if changes are needed in the anti-rejection medicines.</p>

                                            <h1>Tumor Ablation for Liver Cancer</h1>

                                                <p>Ablation is treatment that destroys liver tumors without removing them. These techniques are used in patients with a few small tumors and when surgery is not a good option (often because of poor health or reduced liver function). They are less likely to cure the cancer than surgery, but they can still be very helpful for some people. These treatments are also sometimes used in patients waiting for a liver transplant.</p>
                                                <p>Ablation is best used for tumors no larger than about 3 cm across (a little over an inch). For slightly larger tumors (3 to 5 cm across), it may be used along with embolization (see next section). Because ablation often destroys some of the normal tissue around the tumor, it might not be a good choice for treating tumors near major blood vessels, the diaphragm, or major bile ducts.</p>
                                                <p>People getting this type of treatment typically do not require a hospital stay. Often, ablation can be done without surgery by inserting a needle or probe into the tumor through the skin. The needle or probe is guided into place with ultrasound or CT scanning. Sometimes, though, to be sure the treatment is aimed at the right place, it may be done during surgery.</p>
                                                <h3>Radiofrequency ablation (RFA)</h3>
                                                <p>This procedure uses high-energy radio waves for treatment. The doctor inserts a thin, needle-like probe into the tumor. A high-frequency current is then passed through the tip of the probe, which heats the tumor and destroys the cancer cells. This is a common treatment method for small tumors.</p>
                                                <h3>Ethanol (alcohol) ablation</h3>
                                                <p>This is also known as <em>percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI)</em>. In this procedure, concentrated alcohol is injected directly into the tumor to kill cancer cells.</p>
                                                <h3>Microwave thermotherapy</h3>
                                                <p>In this procedure, microwaves transmitted through the probe are used to heat and destroy the abnormal tissue.</p>
                                                <h3>Cryosurgery (cryotherapy)</h3>
                                                <p>This procedure destroys a tumor by freezing it using a thin metal probe. The probe is guided into the tumor and then very cold gasses are passed through the probe to freeze the tumor, killing the cancer cells. This method may be used to treat larger tumors than the other ablation techniques, but it sometimes requires general anesthesia (where you are deeply asleep and not able to feel pain).</p>
                                                <h3>Side effects of ablation therapy</h3>
                                                <p>Possible side effects after ablation therapy include abdominal pain, infection in the liver, and bleeding into the chest cavity or abdomen. Serious complications are uncommon, but they are possible.</p>



                                                <h1>Embolization Therapy for Liver Cancer</h1>

                                                    <p>Embolization is a procedure that injects substances to try to block or reduce the blood flow to cancer cells in the liver.</p>
                                                    <p>The liver is unusual in that it has 2 blood supplies. Most normal liver cells are fed by branches of the portal vein, whereas cancer cells in the liver are usually fed by branches of the hepatic artery. Blocking the branch of the hepatic artery feeding the tumor helps kill off the cancer cells, but it leaves most of the healthy liver cells unharmed because they get their blood supply from the portal vein.</p>
                                                    <p>Embolization is<em> </em>an option for some patients with tumors that cannot be removed by surgery. It can be used for tumors that are too large to be treated with ablation (usually larger than 5 cm across). It can also be used with ablation. Embolization does reduce some of the blood supply to the normal liver tissue, so it may not be a good option for some patients whose liver has been damaged by diseases such as hepatitis or cirrhosis.</p>
                                                    <p>People getting this type of treatment typically do not stay in the hospital.</p>
                                                    <p>It isn't yet clear which type of embolization has a better long-term outcome.</p>
                                                    <h3>Arterial embolization</h3>
                                                    <p>Arterial embolization is also known as <em>trans-arterial embolization</em> (or TAE). In this procedure a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) is put into an artery through a small cut in the inner thigh and threaded up into the hepatic artery in the liver. A dye is usually injected into the bloodstream at this time to help the doctor monitor the path of the catheter via angiography, a special type of x-ray. Once the catheter is in place, small particles are injected into the artery to plug it up.</p>
                                                    <h3>Chemoembolization</h3>
                                                    <p>This<strong> </strong>approach, also known as <em>trans-arterial chemoembolization</em> (or TACE) combines embolization with chemotherapy. Most often, this is done by using tiny beads that give off a chemotherapy drug for the embolization. TACE can also be done by giving chemotherapy through the catheter directly into the artery, then plugging up the artery.</p>
                                                    <h3>Radioembolization</h3>
                                                    <p>This technique combines embolization with radiation therapy and is sometimes known as <em>trans-arterial radioembolization</em>.</p>
                                                    <p>In the United States, this is done by injecting small beads (called <em>microspheres</em>) that have a radioactive isotope (yttrium-90) stuck to them into the hepatic artery. Brand names for these beads include TheraSphere and SIR-Spheres. Once infused, the beads lodge in the blood vessels near the tumor, where they give small amounts of radiation to the tumor site for several days. The radiation travels a very short distance, so its effects are limited mainly to the tumor.</p>
                                                    <h3>Side effects of embolization</h3>
                                                    <p>Possible complications after embolization include abdominal pain, fever, nausea, infection in the liver, gallbladder inflammation, and blood clots in the main blood vessels of the liver. Because healthy liver tissue can be affected, there is a risk that liver function will get worse after embolization. This risk is higher if a large branch of the hepatic artery is embolized. Serious complications are not common, but they are possible.</p>
