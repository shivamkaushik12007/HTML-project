        <h1>Can Liver Cancer Be Found Early?</h1>

            <p>It is often hard to find liver cancer early because signs and symptoms often do not appear until it is in its later stages. Small liver tumors are hard to detect on a physical exam because most of the liver is covered by the right rib cage. By the time a tumor can be felt, it might already be quite large.</p>
            <p>There are no widely recommended screening tests for liver cancer in people who are not at increased risk. (Screening is testing for cancer in people without any symptoms.) But testing might be recommended for some people at higher risk.</p>
            <p>Many patients who develop liver cancer have long-standing cirrhosis (scar tissue formation from liver cell damage). Doctors may do tests to look for liver cancer if a patient with cirrhosis gets worse for no apparent reason.</p>
            <p>For people at higher risk of liver cancer due to cirrhosis (from any cause) or chronic hepatitis B infection (even without cirrhosis), some experts recommend screening for liver cancer with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) blood tests and ultrasound exams every 6 to 12 months. In some studies, screening was linked to improved survival from liver cancer.</p>
            <p>Ultrasound uses sound waves to take pictures of internal organs.</p>
            <p>AFP is a protein that can be present at increased levels in patients with liver cancer. But looking at AFP levels isn't a perfect test for liver cancer. Many patients with early liver cancer have normal AFP levels. Also, AFP levels can be increased from other kinds of cancer as well as some non-cancerous liver conditions.</p>
            <p>The American Cancer Society does not have recommendations for liver cancer screening.</p>


                        <h1>Signs and Symptoms of Liver Cancer</h1>

                            <p>Signs and symptoms of liver cancer often do not show up until the later stages of the disease, but sometimes they may show up sooner. If you go to your doctor when you first notice symptoms, your cancer might be diagnosed earlier, when treatment is most likely to be helpful. Some of the most common symptoms of liver cancer are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Weight loss (without trying)</li>
                                <li>Loss of appetite</li>
                                <li>Feeling very full after a small meal</li>
                                <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
                                <li>An enlarged liver, felt as a mass under the ribs on the right side</li>
                                <li>An enlarged spleen, felt as a mass under the ribs on the left side</li>
                                <li>Pain in the abdomen or near the right shoulder blade</li>
                                <li>Swelling or fluid build-up in the abdomen</li>
                                <li>Itching</li>
                                <li>Yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Some other symptoms can include fever, enlarged veins on the belly that can be seen through the skin, and abnormal bruising or bleeding.</p>
                            <p>People who have chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis may feel worse than usual or just have changes in lab test results, such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels.</p>
                            <p>Some liver tumors make hormones that act on organs other than the liver. These hormones may cause:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>High blood calcium levels (hypercalcemia), which can cause nausea, confusion, constipation, weakness, or muscle problems</li>
                                <li>Low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia), which can cause fatigue or fainting</li>
                                <li>Breast enlargement (gynecomastia) and/or shrinkage of the testicles in men</li>
                                <li>High counts of red blood cells (erythrocytosis) which can cause someone to look red and flushed</li>
                                <li>High cholesterol levels</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Many of the signs and symptoms of liver cancer can also be caused by other conditions, including other liver problems. Still, if you have any of these problems, it's important to see your doctor right away so the cause can be found and treated, if needed.</p>


                            <h1>Tests for Liver Cancer</h1>

                                <p>If you have some of the signs and symptoms of liver cancer, your doctor will try to find if they are caused by liver cancer or something else.</p>
                                <h2>Medical history and physical exam</h2>
                                <p>Your doctor<em> </em>will ask about your medical history to check for risk factors and learn more about your symptoms. Your doctor will also examine you for signs of liver cancer and other health problems, probably paying special attention to your abdomen and checking your skin and the whites of your eyes looking for jaundice (a yellowish color).</p>
                                <p>If symptoms and/or the results of the physical exam suggest you might have liver cancer, other tests will probably be done. These might include imaging tests, lab tests, and other procedures.</p>
                                <h2>Imaging tests</h2>
                                <p>Imaging tests use x-rays, magnetic fields, or sound waves to create pictures of the inside of your body. Imaging tests are done for a number of reasons, including:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>To help find suspicious areas that might be cancerous</li>
                                    <li>To help diagnose liver cancer</li>
                                    <li>To help a doctor guide a biopsy needle into a suspicious area to take a sample</li>
                                    <li>To learn how far cancer might have spread</li>
                                    <li>To help guide certain treatments in the liver</li>
                                    <li>To help determine if treatment has been effective</li>
                                    <li>To look for a possible recurrence of the cancer</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>People who have (or may have) liver cancer may get one or more of the following tests.</p>
                                <h3>Ultrasound</h3>
                                <p>Ultrasound is often the first test used to look at the liver.</p>
                                <p>Ultrasound (ultrasonography) is the use of sound waves to create an image on a video screen. This test can show masses (tumors) growing in the liver, which then can be tested for cancer, if needed.</p>
                                <h3>Computed tomography (CT)</h3>
                                <p>The CT scan is an x-ray test that produces detailed cross-sectional images of your body. A CT scan of the abdomen can help identify many types of liver tumors. It can provide precise information about the size, shape, and position of any tumors in the liver or elsewhere in the abdomen, as well as nearby blood vessels. CT scans can also be used to guide a biopsy needle precisely into a suspected tumor (called a <em>CT-guided needle biopsy</em>). If you are found to have liver cancer, a CT of your chest may also be done to look for possible spread to the lungs.</p>
                                <h3>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</h3>
                                <p>Like CT scans, MRI scans provide detailed images of soft tissues in the body. But MRI scans use radio waves and strong magnets instead of x-rays. The energy from the radio waves is absorbed and then released in a pattern formed by the type of body tissue and by certain diseases. A computer translates the pattern into a very detailed image of parts of the body.</p>
                                <p>MRI scans can be very helpful in looking at liver tumors. Sometimes they can tell a benign tumor from a malignant one. They can also be used to look at blood vessels in and around the liver, and can help show if liver cancer has spread to other parts of the body.</p>
                                <h3>Angiography</h3>
                                <p>An angiogram is an x-ray test that looks at blood vessels. Contrast medium, or dye, is injected into an artery to outline blood vessels while x-ray images are taken.</p>
                                <p>Angiography can be used to show the arteries that supply blood to a liver cancer, which can help doctors decide if a cancer can be removed and to help plan the operation. It can also be used to help guide some types of non-surgical treatment, such as embolization (see the section Embolization Therapy for Liver Cancer).</p>
                                <p>Angiography can be uncomfortable because a small catheter (a flexible hollow tube) must be put into the artery leading to the liver to inject the dye. Usually the catheter is put into an artery in your groin and threaded up into the liver artery. You have to stay very still while the catheter is in place. A local anesthetic is often used to numb the area before inserting the catheter. Then the dye is injected quickly to outline all the vessels while the x-rays are being taken.</p>
                                <p>Angiography may also be done with a CT scanner (CT angiography) or an MRI scanner (MR angiography). These techniques are often used instead of x-ray angiography because they can give information about the blood vessels in the liver without the need for a catheter in the artery. You will still need an IV line so that a contrast dye can be injected into the bloodstream during the imaging.</p>
                                <h3>Bone scan</h3>
                                <p>A bone scan can help look for cancer that has spread (metastasized) to bones. Doctors don't usually order this test for people with liver cancer unless you have symptoms such as bone pain, or if there's a chance you may be eligible for a liver transplant to treat your cancer. .</p>
                                <p>For more information about imaging tests see the section Exams and Tests to Find and Diagnose Cancer.</p>
                                <h2>Other tests and procedures</h2>
                                <p>Other types of tests may be done if your doctor thinks you might have liver cancer but the imaging test results aren't conclusive.</p>
                                <h3>Laparoscopy</h3>
                                <p>Laparoscopy can be used for liver cancer:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>To help doctors confirm a diagnosis of cancer through biopsy</li>
                                    <li>To confirm the stage or (extent) of the cancer</li>
                                    <li>To help plan surgery or other treatments</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Laparoscopy is usually done at an outpatient surgery center. In this procedure, a doctor inserts a thin, lighted tube with a small video camera on the end through a small incision (cut) in the front of the abdomen to look at the liver and other internal organs. (Sometimes more than one cut is made.) This procedure is done in the operating room. Usually you are under general anesthesia (in a deep sleep), although sometimes the person may just be sedated (made sleepy) and the area of the incision will be numbed.</p>
                                <p>Because the surgeon only makes a small incision to insert the tubes, you should not have much pain after surgery. You should be able to go home after you recover from the anesthesia.</p>
                                <h3>Biopsy</h3>
                                <p>A biopsy is the removal of a sample of tissue to see if it is cancer. Sometimes, the only way to be certain that liver cancer is present is to take a biopsy and look at it under a microscope.</p>
                                <p>But in some cases, doctors can be fairly certain that a person has liver cancer based on the results of imaging tests such as CT and MRI scans. In these cases, a biopsy may not be needed. Doctors are often concerned that sticking a needle into the tumor or otherwise disturbing it without completely removing it might help cancer cells spread to other areas. This is a major concern if a liver transplant might be an option to try to cure the cancer, as any spread of the cancer might make the person ineligible for a transplant. That is why some experts recommend that patients who could be transplant candidates only have biopsies done at the center where the transplant will be done.</p>
                                <p>If a biopsy is needed, it can be done in several ways. For more information about biopsies and how they are tested, see Testing Biopsy and Cytology Specimens for Cancer</p>
                                <p><strong>Needle biopsy:</strong> A hollow needle is placed through the skin in the abdomen and into the liver. The skin is first numbed with local anesthesia before the needle is placed. Different-sized needles may be used.</p>
                                <p><strong>Laparoscopic biopsy: </strong>Biopsy specimens can also be taken during laparoscopy. This lets the doctor see the surface of the liver and take samples of abnormal-appearing areas.</p>
                                <p><strong>Surgical biopsy: </strong>An incisional biopsy (removing a piece of the tumor) or an excisional biopsy (removing the entire tumor and some surrounding normal liver tissue) can be done during an operation.</p>
                                <h2>Lab tests</h2>
                                <p>Your doctor could order lab tests for a number of reasons:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>To help diagnose liver cancer</li>
                                    <li>To help determine what might have caused your liver cancer</li>
                                    <li>To learn how well your liver is working, which can affect what types of treatments you can have</li>
                                    <li>To get an idea of your general health and how well your other organs are working, which also could affect what types of treatments you can have</li>
                                    <li>To see how well treatment is working</li>
                                    <li>To look for signs that the cancer has come back after treatment</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>Alpha-fetoprotein blood (AFP) test</h3>
                                <p>AFP is normally present at high levels in the blood of fetuses but drops to low levels shortly after birth. Levels in adults can go up from liver disease, liver cancer, or other cancers.</p>
                                <p>If AFP levels are very high in someone with a liver tumor, it can be a sign that liver cancer is present. But because liver cancer isn't the only reason for high AFP levels and many patients with early liver cancer have normal levels of AFP, it isn't very helpful in determining if a liver mass might be cancer.</p>
                                <p>This test is sometimes useful in people already diagnosed with liver cancer. The AFP level can help determine what treatment might be an option. During treatment, the test can be used to help give an idea of how well it is working, as the AFP level should go down if treatment is effective. The test can be used after treatment as well, to look for possible signs that the cancer has come back (recurred).</p>
                                <h3>Other blood tests</h3>
                                <p><strong>Liver function tests (LFTs):</strong> Because liver cancer often develops in livers already damaged by hepatitis and/or cirrhosis, doctors need to know the condition of your liver before starting your treatment. A series of blood tests can measure levels of certain substances in your blood that show how well your liver is working.</p>
                                <p>If the part of your liver not affected by cancer isn't working well, you might not be able to have surgery to try to cure the cancer, as the surgery might require removal of a large part of your liver. This is a common problem in people with liver cancer.</p>
                                <p><strong>Blood clotting tests:</strong> The liver also makes proteins that help blood clot when you bleed. A damaged liver might not make enough of these clotting factors, which could increase your risk of bleeding. Your doctor may order blood tests such as a prothrombin time (PT) to help assess this risk.</p>
                                <p><strong>Tests for viral hepatitis:</strong> Your doctor might order blood tests to check for hepatitis B and C.</p>
                                <p><strong>Kidney function tests:</strong> Tests of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are often done to assess how well your kidneys are working.</p>
                                <p><strong>Complete blood count (CBC): </strong>This test measures levels of red blood cells (which carry oxygen throughout your body), white blood cells (which fight infections), and platelets (which help the blood clot). It gives an idea of how well the bone marrow (where new blood cells are made) is functioning.</p>
                                <p><strong>Blood chemistry tests and other tests:</strong> Blood chemistry tests check the levels of a number of substances in the blood, some of which might be affected by liver cancer. For example, liver cancer can raise blood levels of calcium, while blood glucose levels may fall. Liver cancer can also sometimes raise cholesterol levels, so this may be checked as well.</p>
